Allow for numerics when referencing weapons and spells by adding to an arsenal list
Global log returned for Nathan's code.
Multiple do's stop if target dies and don't look for a new target
Maintain above while modifying the `use` command to run similarly to put but the default case calls to weapons or cast or actions
This is to allow more specific references and to make appending fudges more streamlined. Also allows you to swap out the do section of what you are calling.
If I wanted to call a blessed and boosted greatsword I would:
put -p blessed -c "do -l 1d4"
put -p boosted -c "do -l 1d6"
use -p blessed -c "-s zanros -t bigbad -d boosted" #Then how does boosted know to call greatsword?
use -p blessed+boosted+greatsword boosted+javelin -c "-s zanros -t bigbad -d"
Have a cascading effect like above?
it would be
blessed.update(-c)
boosted.update(blessed)
greatsword.update(boosted)
